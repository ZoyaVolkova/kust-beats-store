In the event the number of master recordings hereunder is no more than one (1), then all references to "Masters" hereunder shall be read and deemed to refer to one (1) "Master." For good and valuable consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged), the parties hereby agree as follows:            <ol>              <li> <b>Product Commitment:</b>                 Producer shall produce one (1) musical composition entitled "The Beat Title (Contract Preview Only)" (the "Composition") embodying Artist's featured performance of a yet-to-be-titled master recording (the "Master") for delivery to Artist for, among other exploitations, the manufacture and distribution of records. For the avoidance of doubt, the Composition provided by Producer to create the Master shall be solely retained and owned by Producer as a pre-existing composition, and the composition made by Artist hereunder is a derivative. The territory of this agreement shall be the Universe. Artist acknowledges the satisfactory delivery, receipt, and acceptance of the Master. </li>              <li> <b>Rights:</b>                 The Master (expressly excluding the underlying musical composition), from the inception of creation, shall be considered a "work made for hire" for Artist (or Artist's designees) within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976 (Title 17, U.S.C.). If it is determined that any Master does not so qualify, then that Master, together with all rights therein (including the sound recording copyright(s) but excluding the underlying musical composition) shall hereby be deemed transferred to Artist. Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this agreement, Artist shall have the sole and exclusive right in perpetuity and throughout the universe, including, without limitation: (i) to manufacture, advertise, sell, license or, otherwise dispose of the Master and derivatives derived therefrom in any manner or media whatsoever upon such terms, and under such trademarks, as Artist elects, or, in Artist's sole discretion, to refrain therefrom; (ii) to perform the Master publicly and to permit the public performance thereof by any method now or hereafter known; and (iii) to include Producer's audio performance in an audio-visual production ("Video"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Artist (or its designees) shall have no right to make any edits/changes to Producer's composition; no right to use Producer's composition apart from the Master; and no right to use Producer's composition in a way to imply any sort of endorsement. </li>              <li> <b>Fee:</b>                 Artist shall pay to Producer a non-returnable, non-recoupable fee in the amount of Varies, $Varies USD (the "Fee").

Producer hereby agrees to issue or cause to be issued, as applicable, to Artist, or Artist's designees, mechanical licenses (including, without limitation, any "first use" mechanical licenses) and other licenses in respect of each Controlled Composition subject to the same terms and conditions as are applicable to selections and musical compositions written, composed, owned, or controlled, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by Artist, which are embodied on the Master or any recording recorded under this agreement. For that license, on the United States and Canada sales, Artist will pay mechanical royalties at one hundred percent (100%) of the minimum statutory rate, subject to no cap of that rate for albums and/or EPs. For license outside the United States and Canada, the mechanical royalty rate will be the rate prevailing on an industry-wide basis in the country concerned on the date that this agreement has been entered into. Producer hereby grants Artist a license to reproduce Controlled Compositions that are embodied on the Master produced hereunder in synchronization with and in time relation to visual images featuring Artist's performances in so-called promotional "video programs", on a royalty-free basis and in so-called commercial "video programs", in being understood that Producer shall be entitled to Producer's pro-rata share of any royalties attributable to such commercial "video programs". Upon Artist's request Producer shall execute or cause Producer's publishing designee to execute and deliver to Artist, as applicable, all documents required by Artist, as applicable, to effectuate the purpose of this paragraph. </li>              <li> <b>Publishing Rights:</b>                 With respect to the publishing rights and ownership of the underlying composition embodied in the Master, the Artist, and the Producer hereby acknowledge and agree that the underlying composition shall be owned/split between them as follows:                  <ul>                      <li>Licensee, owns 50% of publishing rights. </li>                      <li> Producer Name, owns 50% of publishing rights</li>                  </ul>        </li>        <li> <b>Credit and Likeness:</b>           Artist shall have the right to use and permit others to use Producer's approved name, approved likeness, and other approved identification and approved biographical material concerning the Producer for purposes of trade and otherwise without restriction solely in connection with the Masters recorded hereunder. Artist shall accord (or shall cause to accord) Producer a credit on (i) labels and liner notes of the Master, where applicable, (ii) in all configurations (including in applicable meta-data) derived from the Master, (iii) in all trade and consumer advertisements, including Billboard Magazine strip ads, which pertain exclusively to the Masters hereunder, that are one-quarter (1/4) page or larger in size, placed directly by Artist, and appear in so-called "nationwide" trade publications in the United States.

Artist further acknowledges and agrees that the Composition produced by Producer may previously have been licensed to third parties on a non-exclusive basis. Any licenses granted by Producer, which precede this agreement, shall remain in effect and shall not be affected by this agreement. Artist waives any claims against Producer for any pre-existing licenses for the Composition. Artist further agrees that Artist will not submit any claims against the third-party licensees for their non-exclusive use of the Composition. </li>            <li>Parties hereto shall indemnify and hold each other harmless from any and all third party claims, liabilities, costs, losses, damages or expenses as are actually incurred by the non-defaulting party and shall hold the non-defaulting party, free, safe, and harmless against and from any and all claims, suits, demands, costs, liabilities, loss, damages, judgments, recoveries, costs, and expenses; (including, without limitation, reasonable outside attorneys' fees), which may be made or brought, paid, or incurred by reason of any breach or claim of breach of the warranties and representations hereunder by the defaulting party, their agents, heirs, successors, assigns and employees, which have been reduced to final judgment; provided that prior to final judgment, arising out of any breach of any representations or warranties of the defaulting party contained in this agreement or any failure by defaulting party to perform any obligations on its part to be performed hereunder the non-defaulting party has given the defaulting party prompt written notice of all claims and the right to participate in the defense with counsel of its choice at its sole expense.
